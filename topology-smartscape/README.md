This example shows how to use the Dynatrace Topology and Smartscape API in order to create a service map. 
The example calls the topology REST endpoint and fetches the list of monitored services along with their attributes and
call relations. Sigma.js is then used to visualize this service map directly within your browser.

To use this example with your own Dynatrace environment, just replace the placeholder with your own environment id and API key.
