Perform 2018 - Sample 4

This example is an extension of [Sample 3](../../perform-topology-api/03-topology-processes).

Processes involved in ongoing (and for simplicity reasons also resolved) problems are colored in red.
The Dynatrace Problem API publishes the necessary REST calls that allow for querying for the problem feed, problem details and eventually the events containing the entities involved in the problem.

To use this example with your own Dynatrace environment, just replace the placeholder with your own environment id and API key.
