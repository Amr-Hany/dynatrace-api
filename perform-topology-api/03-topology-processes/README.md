Perform 2018 - Sample 3

This example is a modification of [Sample 2](../02-topology-service-tagging).

Instead of Services a map of dependent processes is getting displayed.
The required data is getting queried from via Dynatrace Topology and Smartscape API via REST Calls.
Visualization is still taken care of by Sigma.js.

To use this example with your own Dynatrace environment, just replace the placeholder with your own environment id and API key.
