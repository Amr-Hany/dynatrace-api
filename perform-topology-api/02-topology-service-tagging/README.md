Perform 2018 - Sample 2

This example extends [Sample 1](../01-topology-services) by adding a custom tag to the service represented by a node when clicked.

Adding a custom tag to an entity is possible by sending a POST request via REST call to the Dynatrace Topology and Smartscape API.

To use this example with your own Dynatrace environment, just replace the placeholder with your own environment id and API key.
